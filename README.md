# Learning

This is a repository that contains some of my projects that I have written when I have been learning programming.<br>
Some of them are very simple (as Java ones), some of them are more complex (like Random Map Generator or Matrix Determinant Calculator).<br>
<br>

## List of Projects sorted by date:<br>

* Komiwoja
<br>  Simple Cpp project from studies, one of the first projects bigger than a few lines. 2018-12<br>

* Dynamic_rest
<br> Another simple Java program. Written to practice Java and dynamic programming. 2019-02<br>
* Spring
<br> My individual python project, written in order to get to know the pygames library and get experience with solving differential equations. 2019-02<br>
* Matrix
<br> Another Cpp project. It implements the Matrix class, which behaves like mathematicall object, and a class to calculate Matrix Determinant. The GUI to this project was created in QT library. The project was written to practice Cpp and Object-Oriented-Programming, and also the creation of GUI-s. 2019-02<br>
* SFML
<br> A big Cpp project. It is an Random Map Generator based on famous Perlin's Noise. Created for fun. 2019-03
