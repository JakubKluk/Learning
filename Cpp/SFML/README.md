This program is an random map generator
based on Perlin's Noise alghoritm.
Written using c++ and SFML library.
It can work in two modes: creating archipelagos
(a bunch of islands) and creating single, big
land mass in the center of the window.
Further informations about parameters and
functions are in the script as a comments.
